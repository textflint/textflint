    "As an introduction to writing transformations for textflint, we’re going to try a very simple transformation: one that replaces random words of a text with the word ‘bread’. In textflint, there’s an abstract `WordSubstitute` class that handles the heavy lifting of breaking sentences into words and avoiding replacement of stopwords. We can extend `WordSubstitute` and implement a single method, `_get_candidates`, to indicate to replace each word with ‘bread’. 🍞"

    "In this tutorial, we show how to use a built-in `Transformation` `AddSum` and define our own `Transformation` `BreadWordSwap`. You also learned how to control the number of transformed words. In fact, you may also find that replacing three words in `BreadWordSwap` makes the result sample meaningless and hard-to-read. Our next section will show you how to use `Validator` to filter out sample that are useless. "
